# NT Bio Printer - Cutting-Edge Bioprinting for Barotrauma

Take submarine medicine to the next level with **NT Bio Printer**, introducing advanced **bioprinting** and **stem cell synthesis** for life-saving **organ and limb fabrication**.

## New Machines

- **Bio Printer** – A high-tech fabricator that creates **functional human organs and limbs** from biological materials.
- **Stem Cell Processor** – Converts **bone marrow** and other materials into **stem cells** for further bioprinting.

## Core Features

- **Organ & Limb Printing:** Use the Bio Printer to craft **transplantable organs and fully functional limbs** with a mix of **stem cells, biological material, and Thiamine or Calcium**.
- **Bone Marrow Extraction:** Harvest **bone marrow** using syringes, but be cautious—**excessive extraction can lead to bone damage**. Bone marrow can only be extracted from **drilled bones**, ensuring a realistic and immersive medical process.
- **Stem Cell Synthesis:** Process bone marrow into **stem cells** for use in advanced medical procedures.
- **Limb Replacement:** Printed **arms and legs** can be surgically attached to patients, restoring lost functionality.
- **Surgical Integration:** All printed body parts must be surgically implanted following **Neurotrauma’s** medical guidelines.
- **Skill-Based Mechanics:** Printing complex body parts requires **higher medical skill levels**.
- **Afflictions & Side Effects:** Bone marrow extraction can cause **pain, fractures, and internal bleeding** if done improperly.

## New Medical Items

- **Bone Marrow Syringe** – A syringe filled with extracted **bone marrow**, a key ingredient for stem cell production.
- **Stem Cell Syringe** – Vital for **biological material synthesis** in the Bio Printer.
- **Biological Material Syringe** – The building block of all **printed organs and limbs**.

Master the art of **bioprinting and regenerative medicine**, revolutionizing the way submariners survive in the abyss.
