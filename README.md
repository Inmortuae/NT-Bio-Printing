# NT Organ Printer

Welcome to NT Organ Printer, a mod for Barotrauma that enhances the medical mechanics by introducing advanced bioprinting technology.

## Features

- **Organ Printer**: A high-tech medical fabricator for creating functional human organs.
- **Bone Marrow Extraction**: Perform surgery to extract marrow for stem cell synthesis from **any limb**.
- **Stem Cell Culturing**: Combine with genetic material to create biological material.
- **Organ Fabrication**: Use biological material and Thiamine to produce transplantable organs.
- **Medical Skill Dependency**: More complex organs require higher medical expertise to fabricate.
- **Surgical Integration**: Printed organs must be surgically implanted following Neurotraumaâ€™s medical procedures.
- **Bone Marrow Affliction**: Excessive marrow extraction can lead to bone death.

## Crafting

### Basic Organ Printing

- **Ingredients**:
  - Biological Material
  - Thiamine
- **Requirements**: Medical skill varies by organ type
- **Crafting Time**: 45-90 seconds

### Advanced Organ Printing

- **Ingredients**:
  - Stem Cells
  - Biological Material
  - Thiamine
- **Requirements**: High Medical skill
- **Crafting Time**: 120 seconds

### Bone Marrow Extraction

- **Requirements**:
  - Perform surgery to **drill bones in any limb (arms, legs, torso)**
  - Extract marrow with an empty syringe
- **Effects**:
  - Partial extraction allows marrow to regenerate over time.
  - Full extraction **prevents regeneration**, leading to **Bone Death**, causing severe debilitation or fatal complications in the affected limb.

## Building the Organ Printer

### Construction Requirements
